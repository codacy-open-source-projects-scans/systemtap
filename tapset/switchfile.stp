 * sfunction switch_file - switch to the next output file
 *
 * Description: This function sends a signal to the stapio process,
 * commanding it to rotate to the next output file when output is
 * sent to file(s).
 *
 * The mechanism of switching files was changed by upstream commit
 * 5b39471380a238469c8fc18136f12600e5e9aec7 .  With this commit, the
 * rotation only works if there is some actual systemtap output.
