This is a collection of tests for systemtap.

Running the Testsuite
*********************

There are two ways to run the testsuite and pass additional parameters to
DejaGnu.  The first is to do `make check' in the main build directory and,
if desired, selecting parts of the testsuite with `RUNTESTFLAGS':

      % make check RUNTESTFLAGS='argv.exp -v --debug'

"make check" runs unprivileged tests only against an uninstalled build tree,
and can be run without special privileges.

"make installcheck" runs all tests against an installed tree.  It requires
root and/or sudo/stapdev privileges.

      # make installcheck RUNTESTFLAGS=

Runs whole the testsuite.

      # make installcheck RUNTESTFLAGS='argv.exp add.exp'

Runs only two test cases.
